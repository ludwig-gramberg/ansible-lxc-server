## Roles

- certbot installation and configuration on master and optional cert-deployment to containers
- munin setup and container-integration (detect roles of container and provision container with appropriate plugins?)
- full youtrack setup via ansible (not just a shell-role)
- generate icinga2 monitoring conf-files for easy integration
- maybe put iptables into its own role?

## IPv6

- allow incoming ipv6 for websites
- ipv6-address for containers
- does this still require a bridge?
